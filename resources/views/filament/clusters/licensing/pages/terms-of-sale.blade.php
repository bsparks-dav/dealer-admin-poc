            <li class="my-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Orders.</span> All orders placed by Dealer are subject to acceptance by Davidson's. Davidson's reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to

                <span class="font-bold">Terms of Payment.</span> Unless payment terms are approved for Dealer by Davidson's in advance, all orders shall be either cash on delivery or paid in
                    advance of shipment. Payment terms for approved Dealer accounts, unless otherwise specified by Davidson's, will be net thirty (30) days from the date of Davidson's
                    invoice. In the event Dealer fails to make any payment to Davidson's when due, (i) in addition to any other remedies available at law, Davidson's reserves the
                    right to terminate this Agreement and/or any Dealer order or to suspend further performance under this Agreement, any other agreements and/or purchase orders
                    with Dealer; (ii) Dealer shall be liable for all expenses, including attorneys' fees and other litigation costs, relating to the collection of past due amounts,
                    (iii) Dealer's entire account balance with Davidson's shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand by Davidson's, and (iv) all unpaid
                    amounts shall thereafter bear interest until paid in full at a rate as determined by Davidson's, which rate shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law.
                    Should Dealer's financial responsibility become unsatisfactory to Davidson's, cash payments or security satisfactory to Davidson's may be required by
                    Davidson's (including, without limitation, letters of credit) for Goods delivered thereafter. If such cash payments and/or security are not provided, in
                    addition to Davidson's other rights and remedies, Davidson's may discontinue the shipment of Goods to Dealer. Dealer hereby grants Davidson's a purchase
                    money security interest in all Goods sold to Dealer by Davidson's, which security interest shall continue until such Goods are fully paid for in cash, and
                    Dealer: (a) upon Davidson's demand, will execute and deliver to Davidson's such instruments as Davidson's requests to protect and perfect such security interest,
                    and (b) authorizes Davidson's to execute and file such instruments as are necessary or useful to protect and perfect such interest.

                <span class="font-bold">Shipment.</span> Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Davidson's, all Goods sold by Davidson's to Dealer shall be delivered FOB place of shipment and
                    Dealer shall bear all risk of loss following delivery of Goods to the common carrier. Delivery dates are estimated based upon conditions prevailing at the date
                    of Davidson's acceptance of an order and are subject to change based upon conditions existing at the time of scheduled delivery or any subsequent change in
                    conditions that materially affect Davidson's ability to acquire Goods ordered. Davidson's will have no liability for such changes, but will provide reasonable
                    notice of any changes to Dealer. If Davidson's is to pay freight, Davidson's shall have the right to designate routing and means of transportation; and if Dealer
                    requires a more expensive routing and/or means, Dealer will pay any extra cost involved. The cost of any special packing or special handling as a result of
                    Dealer's requirements shall be added to the amount of the order of the applicable Goods. If the shipment of Goods is postponed or delayed by Dealer for any
                    reason, Dealer agrees to reimburse Davidson's for any handling and storage costs and other additional expenses resulting therefrom.

                    agency relating any such missing firearms.

                    Davidson's net income or profit, will be for Dealer's account and will either be added to the price of Goods (unless Dealer provides Davidson's with an
                    exemption certificate acceptable to the applicable taxing authorities) and paid for by Dealer or billed to Dealer separately (unless Dealer provides
                    Davidson's with an exemption certificate acceptable to the applicable taxing authorities), as Davidson's may elect in its sole discretion.

                <span class="font-bold">Limited Warranty with Respect to Firearms.</span> Any firearm sold by Davidson's to Dealer that becomes defective while owned by the Dealer or
                    the original consumer purchaser from Dealer will be eligible for Davidson's GuaranteeD™ Lifetime Replacement Program as set forth at www.galleryofguns.com
                    (<span class="font-bold">"GuaranteeD™ Program"</span>). Coverage under the GuaranteeD™ Program extends to any and all parts of the firearm as originally sold by us, but
                    does not extend to any firearm that is altered or rebuilt after original purchase, damaged through abuse, misuse or lack of proper care and maintenance, or
                    used other than for its legal intended purposes. The GuaranteeD™ Program applies only to firearms that are not regulated by The National Firearms Act of 1934,
                    its amendments and rulings. The GuaranteeD™ Program does not cover any other type of merchandise. <span class="font-bold">DAVIDSON'S MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
                    OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</span> Dealer's sole and
                    exclusive remedy for any breach of Davidson's express warranties is described in this Section 7. In the event of a valid claim under the GuaranteeD™ Program,
                    Davidson's will replace the firearm without charge, subject to the terms of the GuaranteeD™ Program, in accordance with the following procedures:
            </li>

                    <li class="my-4">
                        In order to receive coverage under the GuaranteeD™ Program, within 30 days from date of purchase the original purchaser should complete the warranty registration
                        online at www.galleryofguns.com. If a customer of Dealer submits a claim under the GuaranteeD™ Program regarding a firearm originally purchased by Dealer
                        from Davidson's, Dealer shall immediately notify Davidson's and cooperate in the investigation and resolution of the claim, including return of the firearm
                        to Davidson's (such return to be as directed by Davidson's, including any preferred method of shipping, with return shipping costs to be collected from
                        customer and paid by Dealer). If Davidson's determines that the claim qualifies under the GuaranteeD™ Program it will, at no charge, replace the firearm
                        with the same model. If the same model is not available, Davidson's will repair the firearm if the firearm can be repaired, as determined by Davidson's in
                        its sole discretion. If the no replacement is available and Davidson's determines that the firearm cannot be repaired, Davidson's will replace the nonperforming
                        or defective firearm with a firearm that, in Davidson sole determination, is substantially similar to the defective firearm.

                    <li class="my-4">
                        If Dealer submits a claim under the GuaranteeD™ Program pertaining to a firearm not yet sold by Dealer, then upon return of the firearm to Davidson's and
                        its inspection of the firearm and verification that the claim is valid, Davidson's will replace firearm without charge or, if no replacement is available,
                        Davidson's will either provide Dealer with a similar firearm or issue a credit to Dealer for the amount which Dealer paid for the returned firearm.

                        assignment of such rights as reasonably requested by Davidson's. To obtain performance under the GuaranteeD™ Program, Dealer's customer must return the
                        nonperforming or defective firearm to Dealer and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. TO AVOID VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, DEALER'S
